# NASA-project

Little project I'm currently developing as a part of this course:
- https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-nodejs-developer-zero-to-mastery/

Sadly I lost the code because of an error with my remote in VSCode and I'm currently re-doing all the hard work ðŸ™„

The current version of the frontend provided with the course causes some problems because it has
deprecated dependencies and it won't start unless you use Node.js v16.x.x or lesser (I'm using v18.14.0). Although I plan
on to developing and integrating the frontend myself with Next.js.

With this little project I've learned the following:
  - How to implement node and express.
  - How to implement middlewares.
  - Package.json scripting
  - Implement a MVC pattern in Node.js
  - Serving apps with client side Routing
  - Building a Data Access Layer
  - Implementing endpoints and receiving HTTP verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE ...)
  - Testing requests with Postman
  - And many more ...
